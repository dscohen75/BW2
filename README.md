About this file:  

2126 fetal cardiotocograms (CTGs) were automatically processed and the respective diagnostic features measured.   
The CTGs were also classified by three expert obstetricians and a consensus classification label assigned to each of them.   
Classification was both with respect to a morphologic pattern (A, B, C. â€¦) and to a fetal state (N, S, P).   
Therefore the dataset can be used either for 10-class or 3-class experiments.
